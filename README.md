# AI PacMan
This is a series of projects I completed to explore AI concepts through PacMan.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Project 1 focuses on search algorithms to help PacMan efficiently find food pellets.</li>
  <li>Project 2 implements various multi-agent algorithms for PacMan to move and eat optimally against ghosts.</li>
  <li>Project 3 utilizes logic and path planning to make PacMan understand the maze layout and its position through SLAM.</li>
</ul> 
<br>
Each project will have a link to its respective project spec. Follow along to run programs and see visualizations of PacMan.
