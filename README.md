This is a series of projects I completed to explore AI concepts through PacMan.
Project 1 focuses on search algorithms to help PacMan efficiently find food pellets.
Project 2 implements various multi-agent algorithms for PacMan to move and eat optimally against ghosts.
Project 3 utilizes logic and path planning to make PacMan understand the maze layout and its position through SLAM.
Each project will have a link to its respective project spec. Follow along to run programs and see visualizations of PacMan.
